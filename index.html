		<p>Rama was born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala. His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes, such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, and challenges of ethical questions and moral dilemmas.[6] Of all his travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds.<br><br>
        On the auspicious day of approaching Paush Shukla Dwadashi, Vikram Samvat 2080, (dated January 22 Monday, 2024 CE), the new Vigrah (Deity) of the child form of Bhagwan Shri Ram will be installed in the sanctum sanctorum of the ground floor of the new temple being built on the birthplace of Shri Ram.</p>
